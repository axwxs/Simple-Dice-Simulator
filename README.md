# Simple-Dice-Simulator

This a simple dice simulator program. It was created because this idea was listed on a python practice project list. In addition to the actual dice roll simulation it has the option to display the stats for how often each number shows up. Theoretically each number should be close to the expected (1/6) the more you roll the dice.
